GAPProduction
============
Python code used for producing and managing GAP wildlife range maps and habitat models.  This package is used for creating and working with GAP data in the wildlife-habitat relationship and species/range databases.  It includes handy functions to save time performing many tedious tasks and facilitate convenient interaction with the databases through python.  It is for internal use and data development and is not usable to those without permission to access GAP databases.

Users must complete a copy of the gapconfig file, save to a local directory, and use sys.path.append to append that directory to the sys.paths.  

Many functions rely upon the arcpy package from ESRI (10.2.1).

Help files are available in the "/docs/documentation" folder that list and document functions in each of the package's modules.
