FUNCTIONS
    LoadMUSets()
        () -> dictionary
        
        For use in model building workflow.  Returns a dictionary with map unit sets
        and their descriptions, along with an entry that lists all of the map unit
        sets included in the dictionary.
    
    MULists()
        () -> tuple
        
        Returns a list of the names of various MU lists that Nate has made.
    
    MUhasBroadTree()
        () -> tuple
        
        Returns a tuple of MU's with potentially some broad-leaved tree component, which could be very little.
        Could be forest or woodland.  Does not include Mountain Curl-leaf Mahogany as a tree.
    
    MUhasForest()
        () -> tuple
        
        Returns a tuple of MU's that have some forest component, which could be very little.
        MU's were included if the description or name of the MU explicititly stated "forest"
        or if I interpreted it to include dense canopy cover. Swamps included in this list.
    
    MUhasNeedleTree()
        () -> tuple
        
        Returns a tuple of MU's that potentially have some coniferous tree component,
        which could be very little.  Could be forest or woodland. Includes Taxodium (cypress)
        but not Juniper.
    
    MUhasOpen()
        () -> tuple
        
        Returns a tuple of MU's with the possibility of sizable areas without trees.
        Includes marsh, some glades (revise?), rock outcrops, steppe, and others but does
        not include woodlands, flatwoods, savannahs, or shrub-dominated
        areas (could be added via union with MUShrubDom).
    
    MUhasSagebrush()
        () -> tuple
        
        Returns a tuple of sagebrush MU's.
    
    MUhasSaturatedSoil()
        () -> tuple
        
        Returns a tuple of systems with soils that are constantly or very frequently
        saturated.  Must have soils capable of holding water for the length of time
        between flood events for at least one season.  This is meant to be useful
        for species that need wet, saturated soils found in places like swamps and
        marshes.  Includes tidal marshes and swamps, but not sandy beaches because
        the sands drain between floods or heavy rains. Rocky or cobble substrate not
        considered a “soil” for this set.  Systems with soils that are flooded for
        an entire season are included.  Mesic forests that could contain small seeps
        are not included, the systems included have larger wetlands within them as
        specified by the description.  Consider creating a companion list of systems
        that could contain small seeps and fens. Wet meadows are included.
    
    MUhasShrubDom()
        () -> tuple
        
        Returns a tuple of MU's that include any amount of shrub dominated areas.
        Steppe is included but other systems with only intermittent shrub cover are
        not (such as badlands or cliffs).  Woodlands and savannahs with shrub understory
        but sparse tree cover are not included.  Cultivated Cropland is not included.
    
    MUhasWoodland()
        () -> tuple
        
        Returns a tuple of MU's that have some woodland, savanna, flatwoods, or very open tree
        canopy.  MU's were included if the description or name of the MU explicititly stated
        "woodland", "savanna", or "flatwoods" or if I interpreted it to include open canopy.
        The list doesn't include systems that have at most a sparse occurrence of trees.
        Pinyon-juniper woodlands included but not if they were stunted and shrubland like.
        I considered Curl-leaf Mountain Mahogany a shrub, so woodland of it was not inluded
        in this list.  I did include dwarf cypress savanna.
    
    MUisAquatic()
        () -> tuple
        
        Returns a tuple of water and eelgrass bed MU's.
    
    MUisDeveloped()
        () -> tuple
        
        Returns a tuple of developed MU's.
    
    MUisMudflat()
        () -> tuple
        
        Returns a tuple of mudflat MU's.
    
    MUisOrchard()
        () -> tuple
        
        Returns a tuple of orchard and 'high structure agriculture' MU's.
    
    MUisPlaya()
        () -> tuple
        
        Returns a tuple of playa MU's.
    
    MUisRowCrop()
        () -> tuple
        
        Returns a tuple of row crop MU's.
    
    MUisSaturatedSoil()
        () -> tuple
        
        Returns a tuple of systems that are always (rare droughts aside) wet or
        saturated with water throughout.  Seasonally flooded systems are not
        included here.
