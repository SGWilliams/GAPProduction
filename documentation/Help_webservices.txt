FUNCTIONS
    ListServices(url, serviceWildcard='', folderWildcard='', searchFolders=True)
        (string, [string], [string], [boolean]) -> list
        
        Returns a list of the services within a given directory.
        
        Arguments:
        url -- The full url to the directory.
        serviceWildcard -- An optional parameter to indicate text that must be
            within a service's name for that service to be included in the output
            list.
        folderWildcard -- An optional parameter to indicate text that must be
            within a sub-directory's name for that sub-directory to be searched.
        searchFolders -- An optional, boolean parameter, indicating whether you wish
            to search for services within sub-directories. By default, this is set
            to True, meaning that sub-directories will be searched.
