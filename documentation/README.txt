This Python package contains modules that facilitate the querying and processing of
GAP datasets as well as modules that address generic data and file manipulation.  It is a revision of the original "gappack" library that has sensitive information removed and other updates to make it more portable across computing environments. Most importantly, it now requires a config file that stores file pathnames.  

Help files for each module are available within the "documentation" directory.

N. Tarr is the primary administrator for this package and the master repository is https://github.com/nmtarr/GAPage.git.
