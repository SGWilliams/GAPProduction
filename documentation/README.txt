This Python package contains modules that facilitate the querying and processing of
GAP datasets as well as modules that address generic data and file manipulation.  It is a revision of the original "gappack" library that has sensitive information removed and other updates to make it more portable across computing environments. Most importantly, it now requires a config file that stores file pathnames.  

Help files for each module are available within the "documentation" directory.
