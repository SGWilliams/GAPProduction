DESCRIPTION
    # Create a species richness raster for the given species
    #
    # Public functions:
    #
    # ProcessRichness() -- Calculate a richness raster from the passed species
    #
    #

FUNCTIONS
    ProcessRichness(spp, groupName, outDir)
        (list, str, [str]) -> str, str
        
        Creates a species richness raster for the passed species. Also includes a
          csv table listing all the included species and crosswalk information for
          each. Intermediate richness rasters are retained. That is, the code
          processes the rasters in groups of 20, to keep from overloading ArcPy's
          cell statistics; the intermediate richness rasters are retained for
          spot-checking and for potential re-running of species subsets. Refer to
          the output log file for a list of species included in each intermediate
          raster.
        
        Returns the path to the output richness raster and the path to the species
          table.
        
        Arguments:
        spp -- A list of GAP species codes to include in the calculation
        groupName -- The name you wish to use to identify the output directories
            and files (e.g., 'raptors')
        outDir -- An optional parameter, indicating the directory in which you wish
            to place output and intermediate files. By default, it is set to
            C:\Species_Richness
        
        Example:
        >>> ProcessRichness(['aagtox', 'bbaeax', 'mnarox'], 'MyRandomSpecies',             r'C:\GIS_Data\Richness')
        C:\GIS_Data\Richness\MyRandomSpecies_04_Richness\MyRandomSpecies.tif, C:\GIS_Data\Richness\MyRandomSpecies.csv
