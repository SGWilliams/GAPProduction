DESCRIPTION
    ## Module to create species-specific metadata for a range table or model raster.
    ##
    ## Public Function:
    ##
    ## Run() -- Creates and processes the metadata for the input species and file.
    ##
    ##
    ## SpeciesInputs() -- Gives a list of input data layers used by a species
    ##
    ## ScienceBaseCSV() -- Creates a csv file for use in uploading metadata to ScienceBase

FUNCTIONS
    Run(sp, fPath)
        (string, string)
        
        Creates dynamic, species-specific metadata for the input range or model.
        
        Returns True if the function ran successfully. Otherwise, returns False.
        
        Arguments:
        sp -- The species' unique GAP ID
        fPath -- The complete, absolute path to the range table or model raster
            for which you wish to create metadata
        
        Example:
        >>> import gapmetadata as gm
        >>> gm.Run('aadsax', 'des_apa_adsax')
    
    ScienceBaseCSV(species, publicationDate, csvName)
        (list, integer, string) -> pandas DataFrame and saved CSV file.
        
        Creates a dataframe and csv file with rows for species in your list and columns for
            each of the pieces of information needed when updating metadata records on 
            ScienceBase for habitat maps.
        
        Notes:
        The "end_date" column pulls from tblUpdateDateTime, but it's unclear how this table
            is and was populated.  Many entries are blank, so this function uses 2013 if the
            model editing field is blank.
        
        Arguments:
        species -- Python list of GAP species codes to process
        publicationDate -- A year to use as the publication date
        csvName -- Path and name of where to save csv file
        
        Example:
        >>>DF = MakeScienceBaseCSV(["aAMBUx", "bCOHAx", "bAMROx", "bCOMEx"], 
                                   publicationDate = 2017, csvName="T:/temp/SBTable.csv")
    
    SpeciesInputs(strUC, season='all', publishedOnly=True, conusOnly=True, migratory=False)
        (string) -> list
        
        Returns a list of input layers used by one of a species' regional-seasonal models.
            Developed for use with updating metadata on ScienceBase.
        
        Arguments:
        strUC -- A gap species code like "bAMROx".
        season -- The season for which you wish to return models. By default, all
            seasons will be assessed. You may enter: 's' or 'summer' for summer
            models; 'w' or 'winter' for winter models; 'y', 'year', 'yearround', or
            'year-round' for year-round models.
        publishedOnly -- Optional boolean parameter to include only published models.
            By default, it is set as False, which assesses models in all stages.
        conusOnly -- Optional boolean parameter to include only models within CONUS.
            By default, it is set as True, which assesses only CONUS models.
        migratory -- Optional boolean parameter to include migratory models.
            By default, it is set as False, which skips migratory models.
        
        Example:
        >>>inputs = SpeciesInputs("bAMREx")
        ['hydrology', 'elevation']
