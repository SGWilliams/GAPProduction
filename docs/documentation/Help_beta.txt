FUNCTIONS
    MakeRemapList(mapUnitCodes, reclassValue)
        (list, integer) -> list of lists
        
        Returns a RemapValue list for use with arcpy.sa.Reclassify()
        
        Arguments:
        mapUnitCodes -- A list of land cover map units that you with to reclassify.
        reclassValue -- The value that you want to reclassify the mapUnitCodes that you
            are passing to.
        
        Example:
        >>> MakeRemap([1201, 2543, 5678, 1234], 1)
        [[1201, 1], [2543, 1], [5678, 1], [1234, 1]]
    
    RangeTable_NEW(sp, outDir, state=False, includeMigratory=True, includeHistoric=True)
        (string, string, string, string, string) -> string
        
        Creates a comma-delimited text file of the species' range, with fields indicating
            12-digit HUC, origin, presence, reproductive use, and seasonality. Returns
            the full, absolute path to the output text file.
        
        Arguments:
        sp -- The species six-character unique GAP code
        outDir -- The directory within which you wish to place the output text file
        state -- An optional parameter to indicate a state to which you wish to
            limit the result
        includeMigratory -- An optional boolean parameter indicating whether to
            include migratory range in the output. By default, it is set to True
        includeHistoric -- An optional boolean parameter indicating whether to
            include historic/extirpated range in the output. By default, it is set
            to True
        
        Example:
        >>> RangeTable('mNAROx', 'My_Range_Folder', state="OH")
    
    ReclassLandCover(MUlist, reclassTo, keyword, workDir)
        (list) -> map
        
        Builds a national map of select systems from the GAP Landcover used in species
            modeling. Takes several hours to run.
            
        Arguments:
        MUlist -- A list of land cover map unit codes that you want to reclass.
        reclassTo -- Value to reclass the MUs in MUlist to.
        keyword -- A keyword to use for output name.  Keep to <13 characters.
        workDir -- Where to save output and intermediate files.
