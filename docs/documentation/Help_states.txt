DESCRIPTION
    # A module for accessing state boundaries datasets.
    #
    # Public functions:
    #
    # GetStatesLayer() -- Returns an arcpy layer object for the state of interest.
    #
    # GetStatesShp() -- Returns the path to the shapefile of U.S. state and
    #   territory boundaries.
    #
    # GetStateLayer() -- Returns an arcpy layer object for the state boundary.
    #
    # CreateStateFC() -- Creates a feature class of the boundaries for the passed
    #   state.
    #
    #

FUNCTIONS
    CreateStateFC(state, outputFeatureClass, includeMarine=True)
        (string, string, [boolean]) -> arcpy layer object
        
        Creates a feature class of the boundaries for the passed state.
        
        Arguments:
        state -- The two-letter, postal code abbreviation for the state or territory
            of interest.
        outputFeatureClass -- The path and name of the feature class you wish to
            create.
        includeMarine -- An option, boolean parameter indicating whether you wish to
            create a feature class including both terrestrial and marine
            administrative boundaries or just terrestrial boundaries. By default, it
            is set to True, meaning that all boundaries will be returned.
    
    GetStateLayer(state, includeMarine=True)
        (string, [boolean]) -> arcpy layer object
        
        Returns an arcpy layer object for the state boundary.
        
        Arguments:
        state -- The two-letter, postal code abbreviation for the state or territory
            of interest.
        includeMarine -- An option, boolean parameter indicating whether you wish to
            return a layer including both terrestrial and marine administrative
            boundaries or just terrestrial boundaries. By default, it is set to
            True, meaning that all boundaries will be returned.
    
    GetStatesLayer(includeMarine=True)
        ([boolean]) -> arcpy layer object
        
        Returns an arcpy layer object for the U.S. states' and territories'
            boundaries.
        
        Argument:
        includeMarine -- An optional, boolean parameter indicating whether you wish
            to return a layer including both terrestrial and marine administrative
            boundaries or just terrestrial boundaries. By default, it is set to
            True, meaning that all boundaries will be returned.
    
    GetStatesShp(includeMarine=True)
        ([boolean]) -> string
        
        Returns the path to a shapefile of the U.S. states' and territories'
            boundaries.
        
        Argument:
        includeMarine -- An option, boolean parameter indicating whether you wish to
            the shapefile to include both terrestrial and marine administrative
            boundaries or just terrestrial boundaries. By default, it is set to
            True, meaning that all boundaries will be returned.
